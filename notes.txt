As we just want to log all sensor data atm and likely in the future will still want to do so,
we can have a separate file with a single function that gets the current sensor data and logs it.
We can then embed this function into the main loop.
We probably won't clean any data on the Rapsberry Pi and only send it to the game to be processed,
we may need slightly more extensive logging when we receive data for controlling the incline and may
even want the Raspberry Pi to decide if the request incline value was not achievable before a new incline
value was requested or something.
We may also receive less important data like controlling some LED lights in the future so keep that in mind.
We are also probably going to move away from QMTT and to serial so design so that we can quickly and easily
change anything that may affect in terms of logging.

In summary:
- No cleaning data so just dump raw sensor data.
- Be aware that we will need to receive data also that we will want to log - possibly separately though.
- Be aware that we may process this data some what for detecting some sort of "realism" errors with the game that we will want to log.
- Be aware that we are going to move from QMTT to serial.
